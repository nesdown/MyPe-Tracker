# MyPe-Tracker
MyPe Tracker is simple but effective activity tracker that can be used with any pedometer, tracker or wearable.
It provides beautiful and intuitive-understandable UI. All you have to do is to put your steps data after clicking the activity window - and that's it! Fitness gets much easier with MyPe - that's why 'MyPe' means 'MY Pedometer'!

#Notes
<i>Unfortunately there is no concrete interface for automatic collecting data from fitness devices, so there's a need to put all activity data by yourself. I'm working on it now.<i/>
