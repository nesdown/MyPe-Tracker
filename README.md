# MyPe-Tracker
MyPe Tracker is simple but effective activity tracker that can be used with any pedometer, tracker or wearable.
It provides beautiful and intuitive-understandable UI. All you have to do is to put your steps data after clicking the activity window - and that's it! Fitness gets much easier with MyPe (to  the point, 'MyPe' means '<strong>MY Pedometer</strong>')!

#Notes
<i>Unfortunately there is no concrete interface for automatic collecting data from fitness devices, so all the activity data must be added to app by yourself. I'm working on Bluetooth 4.0+ interface support now.<i/>
